# ✈️ Flight Schedule App (React)

This project was completed as part of the **Skyscanner Front-End Software Engineering Job Simulation on Forage**.

## 📋 Task Objectives

As part of the simulation, I was asked to:

2. Install and integrate a calendar component
3. Display the calendar in the main view
4. Add a **"Continue"** button below the calendar
5. Run and pass a basic automated test to verify functionality
